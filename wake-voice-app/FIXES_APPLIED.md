# Fixes Applied

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Missing babel-preset-expo

**Error:**
```
Cannot find module 'babel-preset-expo'
```

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-expo
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Tests now run successfully

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Test Configuration Issues

**Error:**
- Tests failing with React Native component rendering issues
- "Jest environment has been torn down" errors

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Updated test file** (`__tests__/StatusIndicator.test.js`):
   - Wrapped test renders in `act()` 
   - Added proper props to components
   - Created multiple test cases

2. **Created Jest setup file** (`jest.setup.js`):
   - Mocked `@react-native-voice/voice` module
   - Suppressed console warnings in tests

3. **Updated Jest configuration** in `package.json`:
   - Added `transformIgnorePatterns` for React Native modules
   - Added setup file reference

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - All tests passing (2/2)

### ⚠️ Issue 3: Android SDK Not Found

**Error:**
```
Failed to resolve the Android SDK path. Default install location not found: /home/sreeraj/Android/sdk
Error: spawn adb ENOENT
```

**Root Cause:**
Android SDK is not installed on your system.

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive setup guide in `ANDROID_SETUP.md` with 3 options:

1. **Option 1 (Recommended):** Install Android Studio
   - Complete IDE with visual tools
   - Easy emulator management
   - Best for development

2. **Option 2:** Install Android SDK Command Line Tools only
   - Lighter weight
   - Command-line only
   - Good for CI/CD

3. **Option 3:** Use physical Android device
   - No emulator needed
   - Just install `adb` tools
   - Fastest to get started

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES USER ACTION - See ANDROID_SETUP.md

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required to run app):

1. **Install Android SDK** - Choose one option from ANDROID_SETUP.md:
   - Recommended: Install Android Studio (easiest)
   - Alternative: Install SDK command-line tools
   - Quick option: Use physical device with adb

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

3. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME
   adb --version
   ```

4. **Start emulator or connect device**:
   ```bash
   # For emulator:
   emulator -avd <your-avd-name>
   
   # For physical device:
   adb devices
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

### After App is Running:

1. **Test the wake-word functionality**:
   - Say "hey thworks"
   - Speak a command
   - Verify text recognition

2. **Record demo video** (90-180 seconds):
   - Show the app flow
   - Save as DEMO.mp4

3. **Update DECLARATION.md**:
   - Add your name and current date

4. **Initialize Git** (optional):
   ```bash
   ./init-git.sh
   ```
